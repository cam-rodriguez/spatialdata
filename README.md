# spatialdata
some data that i've made, both in shp. and GeoJSON form. 

DISCLAIMER -- <b>this data is not perfect.</b> I'm using open-source software to create the data in a variety of formats, and unless it's for a specific purpose (read: I'm being graded on it), it's either a passion project or a journalism project, and the quality might vary. 


WHAT AM I USING? -- For pretty much everything, I'm using @mapbox 's <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/geojson.io">geojson.io</a>, which is ridiculously convienent as a gis student who doesn't want to fry their laptop and shut down everything in order to make some shapefiles in arcmap. 

CAN I ADD STUFF TO THIS REPOSITORY? -- sure, I don't really care. 

HOW CAN I USE THIS DATA? -- i don't care. but if you want to update me on a project or story you've worked on with it, hit me up @journo_cam on twitter!
